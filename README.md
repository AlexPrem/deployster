Deployster is an extensible resource-centric deployment tool. It allows developers to declare their _desired_ state of the deployment plane & toplogy, and then attempts to migrate from the _current_ state into the _desired_ state.

## Documentation

<aside class="warning">
The documentation is still in its early phases. Some of the information may be a bit out of date or inaccurate. We are sorry for this temporary state and hope to finish documenting Deployster soon!

Deployster documentation can be found at [http://www.deployster.online](http://www.deployster.online).

### And for the lazy...

Deployster is distributed as a Docker image available for running on your machine or servers. Since the image requires a certain set of Docker flags, a simple `bash` script is provided which makes running Deployster a breeze. Here's how:

```bash
curl -sSL -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infolinks/deployster/master/deployster.sh"
./deployster.sh --var my_var="some-value" \
                --var another="some-value" \
                --var-file ./my-variables-file.yaml \
                ./manifest1.yaml ./manifest2.yaml
```

Here's the full run-down of command-line flags available:

```
[arik@arik ~]$ curl -sSL -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infolinks/deployster/master/deployster.sh" && chmod +x ./deployster.sh
[arik@arik ~]$ ./deployster.sh --help

Deployster was written by the team @ Infolinks as a means to improve our deployment process. We plan to gradually open source more & more components of that pipeline in the coming months.

# Outdated

Everything beyond this point _might be_ outdated and is pending review.

<hr>

This invocation registers two variables in the context (`my_var` and
`another`), as well as any variables defined in the `my-variables-file.yaml`
file, and finally another variable (`my_overriding_variable`). If the
`my-variables-file.yaml` also defines `my_overriding_variable`, the
one on the command-line takes precedence **because it was provided
_after_ the `--var-file` argument.

You can also invoke the Deployster Docker image manually, like this:

```bash
docker run -it \                                            # enable interactivity
           -v $(pwd):/deployster/workspace \                # mount your workspace
           -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \   # enable Docker-in-Docker
           infolinks/deployster:latest \                    # the Deployster version to run
           ./my-manifest.yaml \
           --var my_var="some-value" \
           --var another="some-value" \
           --var-file ./my-variables-file.yaml \
           --var my_overriding_variable="overrides 'my_overriding_variable' in the variables file"
 ```

#### Providing context variables

You can provide ad-hoc variables to the context by using the `--var`
flag in the command line, like this:

    --var my_var=some-value

The `my_var` variable will be available in the context for
post-processing the manifest. For example, here's a manifest snippet
that uses the variable:

```YAML
plugs:
    ...

resources:
    my-vm:
        description: {{ my_var }}
```

For a more persistent method of storing your variables (instead of
providing them on the command line) you can store them in YAML variable
files, like this:

```YAML
my_var: some-value
some_person:
    name: Joe
    age: 42
```

Provide it on invocation, like so:

    --var-file /path/my-variables.yaml

You can now use `{{ my_var }}` in your manifest, as well as
`{{ some_person.name }}` or `{{ some_person.age }}`.
