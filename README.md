Deployster is an extensible resource-centric deployment tool. It allows developers to declare their _desired_ state of the deployment plane & toplogy, and then attempts to migrate from the _current_ state into the _desired_ state.

## Documentation

<aside class="warning">
The documentation is still in its early phases. Some of the information may be a bit out of date or inaccurate. We are sorry for this temporary state and hope to finish documenting Deployster soon!

Deployster documentation can be found at [http://www.deployster.online](http://www.deployster.online).

### And for the lazy...

Deployster is distributed as a Docker image available for running on your machine or servers. Since the image requires a certain set of Docker flags, a simple `bash` script is provided which makes running Deployster a breeze. Here's how:

```bash
curl -sSL -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infolinks/deployster/master/deployster.sh"
./deployster.sh --var my_var="some-value" \
                --var another="some-value" \
                --var-file ./my-variables-file.yaml \
                ./manifest1.yaml ./manifest2.yaml
```

Here's the full run-down of command-line flags available:

```
[arik@arik ~]$ curl -sSL -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infolinks/deployster/master/deployster.sh" && chmod +x ./deployster.sh

Deployster was written by the team @ Infolinks as a means to improve our deployment process. We plan to gradually open source more & more components of that pipeline in the coming months.
